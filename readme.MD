# About this project

In 2022, I started playing with Brownie to interact directly with Ethereum smart contracts like Uniswap and SushiSwap. Then I built some simple watchers and trading bots with Python, that would wait for an arbitrage opportunity and then initiate a trade.

While I did successfully create bots that could spot arbitrage opportunities, I didn't make much money (unless you count the Arbitrum airdrop). Simple bots like these just aren't fast enough to compete with arbitragers using flash loans or ultra-fast setups, but I learned a lot about how smart contracts and AMMs work.
